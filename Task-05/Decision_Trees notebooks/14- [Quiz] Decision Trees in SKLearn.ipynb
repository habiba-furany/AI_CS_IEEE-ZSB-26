This is like memorizing the training data! A model designed to have 100% accuracy on training data is unlikely to generalize well to new data. If you pick very large values for your parameters, the model will fit the training set very well but may not generalize well. Try to find the smallest possible parameters that do the job—then, the model will be more likely to generalize well."],"metadata":{"id":"wo2FLU5ZilmD"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"sIZm5nufiEoY"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Import statements\n","from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\n","from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"M_9xGRQbiEoZ"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Read the data.\n","data = np.asarray(pd.read_csv('data.csv', header=None))\n","# Assign the features to the variable X, and the labels to the variable y.\n","X = data[:,0:2]\n","y = data[:,2]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"zFyyYpx-iEoZ"},"outputs":[],"source":["# TODO: Create the decision tree model and assign it to the variable model.\n","model = None"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"_SQ7cLbgiEoa"},"outputs":[],"source":["# TODO: Fit the model.\n","model.fit(None, None)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"zFsXtqHsiEoa"},"outputs":[],"source":["# TODO: Make predictions.
